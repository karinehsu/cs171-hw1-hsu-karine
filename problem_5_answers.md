1. What's missing? Is this bar chart usable in its current form?

The title, labels, and scale are missing. The bar chart is not usable in its current form. 

What is the role of each of the three nested levels of g elements? (keep in mind you'll be adding a title to the chart)

Complete the implementation section below. Is there any consequence if you add the text elements before or after the rect elements? Why?
